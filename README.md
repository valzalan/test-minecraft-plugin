**This is the custom plugin for the evaluation test.**

The .jar of this project is present in the minecraft-server repository, so it is not necessary to build.

If you wish to build it regardless, build the project, and then use the build.xml as an Ant Target.
When building, make sure the class files are created with this folder structure: "out/production/TestPlugin".

If this is not the case, modify the build.xml accordingly.

This will create the .jar in the target folder.
